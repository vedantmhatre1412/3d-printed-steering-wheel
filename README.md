Task was to replace metal steering wheel with 3d printed one for weight reduction.
Target was to manufacture steering wheel under 250 grams, capable of holding all steering forces calculated prior.
Steering wheel was topology optimized in Autodesk Fusion 360 and design was finalized in Solidworks for making it suitable to manufacture.
Ultimaker Cura was used as a slicer
Steering wheel was 3d printed with PETG filament with varying infill.

Skeleton of steering wheel was 100% infilled

Handle was steering wheel was printed at 10% ,15% and 20% infill with grid as infill pattern
But 20% turned out to be suitable after testing practically
